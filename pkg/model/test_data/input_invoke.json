People can change their memories to suit their desires, erasing painful experiences and augmenting happy ones. But what happens when the last memory of a person's life is taken away?\n\nPrompt: Write a short story that explores the themes of identity, memory, and the human condition. Your story should be set in a world where memories can be manipulated, and it should follow a character who has had their last memory taken away.
